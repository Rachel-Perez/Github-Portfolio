  <ul>
    <li><a href="project1.html">Machine Learning Models for the Prediction of Reduced Glass Transition Temperature of Metallic Glasses</a> - This project involved finding a datasetand importing it, preprocessing the data, data visualization, development of train/test splits, and building and testing performance of various machine learning models.</li>
    <li><a href="project2.html">Analysis of ML Models for the Prediction of Reduced Glass Transition Temperature of Metallic Glasses</a> - Building off the ML models I created in the first project, I used analyzed the covariance of the data, the model's feature importance, individual conditional expectation, and more.</li>
